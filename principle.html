          <p>
            Nostr stands for Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays. It is
            a protocol that envisions a new kind of social network — one that is
            open, decentralized, and resilient. Designed with simplicity in
            mind, Nostr utilizes JSON-based event objects and elliptic-curve
            cryptography to provide a platform where messages can be freely
            exchanged without censorship.

          <h2 class="section-title">Understanding Nostr's JSON Structure</h2>
          <p>
            Nostr events are JSON objects that represent the fundamental data
            unit within the protocol. Each event contains several fields:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>id</strong>: A unique identifier for the event.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>kind</strong>: An integer representing the type of event.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>pubkey</strong>: The public key of the user who created
              the event.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>created_at</strong>: A timestamp for when the event was
              created.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>content</strong>: The content of the event (e.g., a
              message).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>tags</strong>: An array of tags for additional context or
              metadata.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>sig</strong>: A cryptographic signature to verify the
              event's integrity and authenticity.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This standardized structure ensures that events are easily created,
            propagated, and verified across the Nostr network.

          <div id="cryptography" class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-section-title">Cryptography in Nostr</h3>
            <p>
              Nostr employs elliptic-curve cryptography to secure
              communications. Each user has a pair of keys: a public key that
              can be shared with anyone, and a private key that remains
              confidential. Information is encrypted and signatures are verified
              to ensure data integrity and authenticity. This cryptographic
              foundation guarantees that only the intended recipients can
              decipher messages and validates the origin of each message.
            </p>

          <!-- Decentralization and User Control -->
          <div id="decentralization" class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-section-title">Decentralization and User Control</h3>
            <p>
              Nostr's decentralized nature means no central entity has control
              over the network. Users are in command of their data, choosing
              which relays to publish to and subscribe from. This distribution
              of power fosters a resilient network immune to single points of
              failure and censorship.

            <h3 class="sub-section-title">Principle of Relays</h3>
            <p>
              Relays in Nostr function as servers that pass messages but don't
              control the network. They are interchangeable and operate based on
              the principle of redundancy, ensuring that if one relay goes down,
              others are available to take its place, maintaining the network's
              robustness.

          <h2 class="section-title">Getting Started with Nostr</h2>
          <p>
            Engaging with Nostr begins with choosing a client, which serves as
            your interface for the network. From there, you can select relays to
            connect to and start publishing or subscribing to content. As an
            open protocol, anyone can build upon Nostr, creating diverse
            applications and services.
